//  Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of several employees. 
// The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays 
// “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You’re given a list of the employees of the company,
// the number of hours each employee worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. 
// Your program should input this information for each employee and should determine and display the employee's gross pay
